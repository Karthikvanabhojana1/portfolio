          Hey everyone! I'm Karthik Vanabhojana, and I am pursuing my <span className=' text-rose-700'>Master's in Information Systems at Northeastern Univeristy Boston</span>. üéìüíª I'm all about using tech to solve real-life puzzles.
        </p>
        
        <p className='text-lg text-slate-800 pb-10  text-white'>
          I'm into <span className=' text-rose-700'>Linux, shell scripting, and Java</span>, and I'm always up for learning and teaming up on cool software projects. I love the fast-paced vibe of tech and can communicate techy stuff in plain English too. 
        </p>

        <p className='text-lg text-slate-800 pb-10  text-white'>
          Oh, and I've played around with <span className=' text-rose-700'>AWS, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and git </span>‚Äì you know, the usual tech party. Plus, I've dabbled in open source, 'cause sharing is caring, right? üåê
        </p>

        <p className='text-lg text-slate-800 pb-10  text-white'>
In addition to that I have worked in Accenture for two years as <span className='text-rose-700'>Java Backend Developer in Bangalore </span>where I have worked on various projects and have gained experience in various technologies such as <span className='text-rose-700'>springboot, microservices, swagger, Junit, Mockito, JPA, Hibernate, Oracle, MySQL, Kafka, Git, JIRA, Agile, Scrum,</span> etc.
        </p>

        <p className='text-lg text-slate-800 pb-10  text-white'>
